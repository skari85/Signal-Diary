# Navigation Button Fixes & Improvements Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Double-Click Navigation Problem ✅ 
**Issue**: First button press moved screen up, second press worked  
**Root Cause**: Next.js Link prefetching was causing layout shifts and navigation issues  
**Solution**: 
- Added `prefetch={false}` to all navigation Links
- This prevents prefetching that was causing the initial layout shift
- Now buttons work correctly on the first press

### 2. Button Size Improvements ✅
**Issue**: Buttons were too small for elderly users  
**Solution**:
- Increased navigation grid buttons from `h-14` to `h-16` (14% larger)
- Increased Settings button from `h-12` to `h-16` (33% larger)
- Increased icon sizes from `w-5 h-5` to `w-6 h-6` for better visibility
- All buttons now have consistent `h-16` height for better accessibility

### 3. Enhanced Button Feedback ✅
**Added**:
- Smooth transition effects (`transition-all duration-200`)
- Active press feedback (`active:scale-95`)
- Visual feedback helps users understand their interaction is registered

## Custom Network Provider Feature ✅

### Current Implementation
The custom network provider feature was already implemented and working well:
- Users can select "Other" from the network provider dropdown
- Custom text input appears for manual entry
- Custom providers are saved and persist between sessions
- Custom providers appear in exported reports

### Improvements Made
- Enhanced visual design with amber-colored highlight box
- Improved placeholder text with examples (e.g., "Regional Mobile, Local Carrier")
